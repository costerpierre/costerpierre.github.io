Welcome!
I am a fourth-year PhD student in Economics at the **University of Southern California**.  

My research focuses on **International Trade**, **Spatial Economics**, and **Environmental Economics**.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I studied at **SciencesPo Paris** and **Universitat Pompeu Fabra**. I also worked at **SciencesPo Paris**, the **European Central Bank**, and the **OECD**. You can view my [CV here](files/CV.pdf).  

Feel free to reach out via email: <pcoster@usc.edu>.

<details><summary><small>Abstract</small></summary><small> <p style="text-align: justify;">This paper studies how firms adjust input sourcing in response to climate policy. Using the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) as a natural experiment and French product-level import and production data, we show that firms increasingly shifted imports of ETS-regulated inputs to non-EU countries over the 2010s as the policy became more stringent, indicating carbon leakage. This leakage is economically significant: the share of ETS-regulated products sourced from outside the EU rose by 4.3 percentage points after the ETS was implemented. Motivated by these empirical findings, we estimate a heterogeneous firm model using pre-ETS data. Simulating the model under a EUR 100 carbon tax reproduces observed leakage, raises domestic prices and modestly reduces French emissions. Adding a carbon tariff similar to the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) reverses the leakage but further increases prices. The combined ETS+CBAM regime is seven times more effective than the ETS alone in reducing emissions.</p> </small></details>
